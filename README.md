#  Car Damage Detection using YOLOv8 üöó

A computer vision project that detects various types of external car damage (scratches, dents, broken lights, etc.) using the state-of-the-art **YOLOv8** object detection model.

---

##  Project Overview

This project uses deep learning (**YOLOv8**) to:

- Detect and localize damage on vehicles
- Classify different damage types (e.g. dent, scratch, broken window)
- Provide fast and accurate predictions for automotive assessments and insurance automation
